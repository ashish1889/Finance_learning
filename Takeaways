October-2024 =>

(1) Indigo Paints 

- Already consolidation over - Can give a good break out anytime - Not much downside left - With Oil price correcting & Diwali quarter results: this is set for a breakout 
Smallcap can generate CAGR of 25-30% over 3 years 

(2) Jyoti Resins (new add) 

- This used to be in my portfolio earlier. I did a swing sold it, adding again - Has been in 2 year consolidation - Numbers have been good 
Smallcap, so can generate a CAGR of 25-30% over 3 years 

(3) Kotak Bank 

- Very strong volume coming in Kotak Bank - This seems like a sector rotation - Whenever serious money comes to India, this will move 
I am expecting a CAGR of 20% over 3 years on this (because this has become a deep value stock now; same applies to HDFC Bank) 

(4) Jio Finance: 

- This has been in a 6 month consolidation - In case you already have a lot of positions on this, then you can avoid for now 
(I had built much earlier, so already in good gains; I am sure some community members would have done that as well) - In case you have never invested in 
Jio Fin: you can do some SIP now - Don't worry about PE on this: the Earning will go up for the firm (so PE will rationalise) - 
My bet is they will do a Neo Bank play at some stage via Jio Fin (that wil be a major trigger for their growth) 

(5) ICICI Securities: 

- I had it earlier; sold it, made money - Will add now (new pick) - I will invest around 33% of my intended money on this 
One community member also asked me to comment on: 

Share India Securities 
- So I analysed the stock, seems good - I might build new positions - Again, it has been in consolidation for 2 years 
But, since Share India has pledged promoter holding, I couldn't really understand the rationale why they would do this. Since, broking is not a large capex business. 

So I feel more comfortable with ICICI securities 

Will write part 2 soon :) 
Let me know your thoughts.

I will be making all these moves tomorrow
