October-2024 =>

(1) Indigo Paints 

- Already consolidation over - Can give a good break out anytime - Not much downside left - With Oil price correcting & Diwali quarter results: this is set for a breakout 
Smallcap can generate CAGR of 25-30% over 3 years 

(2) Jyoti Resins (new add) 

- This used to be in my portfolio earlier. I did a swing sold it, adding again - Has been in 2 year consolidation - Numbers have been good 
Smallcap, so can generate a CAGR of 25-30% over 3 years 

(3) Kotak Bank 

- Very strong volume coming in Kotak Bank - This seems like a sector rotation - Whenever serious money comes to India, this will move 
I am expecting a CAGR of 20% over 3 years on this (because this has become a deep value stock now; same applies to HDFC Bank) 

(4) Jio Finance: 

- This has been in a 6 month consolidation - In case you already have a lot of positions on this, then you can avoid for now 
(I had built much earlier, so already in good gains; I am sure some community members would have done that as well) - In case you have never invested in 
Jio Fin: you can do some SIP now - Don't worry about PE on this: the Earning will go up for the firm (so PE will rationalise) - 
My bet is they will do a Neo Bank play at some stage via Jio Fin (that wil be a major trigger for their growth) 

(5) ICICI Securities: 

- I had it earlier; sold it, made money - Will add now (new pick) - I will invest around 33% of my intended money on this 
One community member also asked me to comment on: 

Share India Securities 
- So I analysed the stock, seems good - I might build new positions - Again, it has been in consolidation for 2 years 
But, since Share India has pledged promoter holding, I couldn't really understand the rationale why they would do this. Since, broking is not a large capex business. 

So I feel more comfortable with ICICI securities 

Will write part 2 soon :) 
Let me know your thoughts.

I will be making all these moves tomorrow

10 good stocks is also fine.. try to stay as diverse as possible in that.. may be 7 stable and 3 risky stocks.. 4 large cap, 4 mid, 2 small etc.. also sector diversification to be considered.
It all depends on risk/reward equations.

One thing new investor should keep in mind which they forget like downward averaging a stock is good but at the same time u need to remember no stock should be more than 6-8% of ur portfolio it's also a high number but when portfolio are small it is like that . 

Averaging down the value buys is good even building a position in new value buys is good but one thing new investor forget that u become such over diversified that it not make sense. Small profolios strugle this larger one have advantages but keep in mind averaging down is good but over concentration of a stocks can sucks

It is important to understand something called consumer cycle. 
We are undergoing this right now: and this is an important concept for retail investors. 

You might be reading the news that: auto sales, FMCG, Banking results -- all are slowing down. 

So is there a fundamental problem? 

Yes. And, no. 

The cycles works this way: 

(1) Low IR (this was 2020,2021) creates more liquidity 

(2) More liquidity= better results for firms 
(3) When IR go high and/or taxes go high = this makes less disposable income for consumers 
(4) And, slower expansion for firms 
(5) As a result, firms post bad results 
(6) To support businesses: the governments then cut IR 

So in this entire game: we are somewhere in step 5 right now 

There seems to be a general slowdown 
(1) All industries are struggling 
(2) They are all likely to post bad results 
(3) IR at all time high (in India) 

What you should focus on is step 6, not step 5. 
You have to buy, when we are in step 5 
And, take a few hits 

An example would be IDFC First Bank 
The bank has posted "bad" results. 

Really? 
(1) From 2021 to 2024: Revenues have 2X, profits have 4X-ed
(2) How are these bad results then? 
(3) On a Q-0-Q basis, these look bad

But, again you need to go to the cycle explained above: in step 5, everyone is going to get hit. 
Your job is to buy at the time of panic. 

Now, it is time to start building positions (slowly...) 

We will accelerate soon. 
It is good to see people starting to worry. 
This means: it is time for us to buy :)

[But, we only buy opportunities for now]
