October-2024 =>

(1) Indigo Paints 

- Already consolidation over - Can give a good break out anytime - Not much downside left - With Oil price correcting & Diwali quarter results: this is set for a breakout 
Smallcap can generate CAGR of 25-30% over 3 years 

(2) Jyoti Resins (new add) 

- This used to be in my portfolio earlier. I did a swing sold it, adding again - Has been in 2 year consolidation - Numbers have been good 
Smallcap, so can generate a CAGR of 25-30% over 3 years 

(3) Kotak Bank 

- Very strong volume coming in Kotak Bank - This seems like a sector rotation - Whenever serious money comes to India, this will move 
I am expecting a CAGR of 20% over 3 years on this (because this has become a deep value stock now; same applies to HDFC Bank) 

(4) Jio Finance: 

- This has been in a 6 month consolidation - In case you already have a lot of positions on this, then you can avoid for now 
(I had built much earlier, so already in good gains; I am sure some community members would have done that as well) - In case you have never invested in 
Jio Fin: you can do some SIP now - Don't worry about PE on this: the Earning will go up for the firm (so PE will rationalise) - 
My bet is they will do a Neo Bank play at some stage via Jio Fin (that wil be a major trigger for their growth) 

(5) ICICI Securities: 

- I had it earlier; sold it, made money - Will add now (new pick) - I will invest around 33% of my intended money on this 
One community member also asked me to comment on: 

Share India Securities 
- So I analysed the stock, seems good - I might build new positions - Again, it has been in consolidation for 2 years 
But, since Share India has pledged promoter holding, I couldn't really understand the rationale why they would do this. Since, broking is not a large capex business. 

So I feel more comfortable with ICICI securities 

Will write part 2 soon :) 
Let me know your thoughts.

I will be making all these moves tomorrow

10 good stocks is also fine.. try to stay as diverse as possible in that.. may be 7 stable and 3 risky stocks.. 4 large cap, 4 mid, 2 small etc.. also sector diversification to be considered.
It all depends on risk/reward equations.

One thing new investor should keep in mind which they forget like downward averaging a stock is good but at the same time u need to remember no stock should be more than 6-8% of ur portfolio it's also a high number but when portfolio are small it is like that . 

Averaging down the value buys is good even building a position in new value buys is good but one thing new investor forget that u become such over diversified that it not make sense. Small profolios strugle this larger one have advantages but keep in mind averaging down is good but over concentration of a stocks can sucks

============================================================================

It is important to understand something called consumer cycle. 
We are undergoing this right now: and this is an important concept for retail investors. 

You might be reading the news that: auto sales, FMCG, Banking results -- all are slowing down. 

So is there a fundamental problem? 

Yes. And, no. 

The cycles works this way: 

(1) Low IR (this was 2020,2021) creates more liquidity 

(2) More liquidity= better results for firms 
(3) When IR go high and/or taxes go high = this makes less disposable income for consumers 
(4) And, slower expansion for firms 
(5) As a result, firms post bad results 
(6) To support businesses: the governments then cut IR 

So in this entire game: we are somewhere in step 5 right now 

There seems to be a general slowdown 
(1) All industries are struggling 
(2) They are all likely to post bad results 
(3) IR at all time high (in India) 

What you should focus on is step 6, not step 5. 
You have to buy, when we are in step 5 
And, take a few hits 

An example would be IDFC First Bank 
The bank has posted "bad" results. 

Really? 
(1) From 2021 to 2024: Revenues have 2X, profits have 4X-ed
(2) How are these bad results then? 
(3) On a Q-0-Q basis, these look bad

But, again you need to go to the cycle explained above: in step 5, everyone is going to get hit. 
Your job is to buy at the time of panic. 

Now, it is time to start building positions (slowly...) 

We will accelerate soon. 
It is good to see people starting to worry. 
This means: it is time for us to buy :)

[But, we only buy opportunities for now]
========================================================================

Some Mutual Funds/Smallcase to SIP:- 

Hi Folks, since there are many beginners in our community. One important question they are asking is: which funds/small-case can they pick right now? 

(For a 3-4 year basis) 

Our goal should always be to buy assets which are at a discount. 

From that point: I would say right now pick 
(Multi asset=this means that the fund invests across different types of asset eg stocks, bonds, RE etc)
(Multi cap/flexicap= this means the fund invests in equities, but across large, small, mid) 
(Nifty 50= Indian market) 
(FoF= collection of international indices) 

The most important criteria here is the expense ratio (which means how much money is charged as commissions) 

This is not an endorsement for any of the following funds. I checked the expense ratio. 
You please do the same exercise. 
And, invest in the ones which have lower commissions. 

1) Kotak Multi Asset Fund; expense ratio 0.3% 
2) Nippon Multi Cap 
3) Nifty 50 (I would pick N50 over any large cap fund, statistically 85% of large cap funds do not beat N50) 
4) Motilal Oswal Nasdaq 100 Fund of Fund

You could consider doing a few SIPs on these.

These you can directly buy via your brokers in India  
If the market dynamics change, we will pick some other assets to SIP. 
This aligns with our thesis of buying discounts. 

Right now: I would avoid sectoral, small/mid caps given the risk. 
Let the market settle, we can pick these then.
========================================================================================

Giving some quick commentary on some stocks that have posted good results. And, have also fallen from their top 

(1) Motilal Oswal 

- The stock's PE is reasonable
- Excellent recent results 
- All time high profit and revenue numbers 
- Stock is around 10-15% fallen from its top 
- This is in an expanding industry, so might make sense to add: if you want exposure to brokerage firms 

(2) PNB 

- Stock has fallen 35-40% from its top 
- Revenue/profits numbers are good 
- The PE compared to its peers is still high, so I expect a slight correction from this point 
- (eg. BoB, Canara is at a better PE) 
- These types of stock you should only buy if they are at a massive discount 

(3) Manapuram Finance: 

- Stock has corrected by around 50% from top 
- All time high revenues/profits 
- RBI action on its gold lending business shook the price 
- But my estimate is: this problem should go away 

(4) IDFC First Bank 

- The results are not as bad people are making it out to be 
- They have increased their provision requirement: 
- My assessment is they are trying to grow responsibly and manage systemic risk 
- This is not bad for long-term investors: it shows the firm is trying to lend responsibly (this is a good sign) 
- As a result of this: there is a revenue problem, not a profit problem 
- If in the next quarter they lower their provisioning requirement, the profits would automatically jump 

(5) Bandhan and Ujjivan 

- Record high profit and revenue numbers
- Both firms trading at 50% discount from top 
- Risk: this is entire risky segment lending risk 
- But this is a cyclical industry: if you play for 4-5 year on these types of stock (and buy in a low cycle), you can expect a 25% CAGR

Now here is what other folks don't tell: all the above 5 -6 business directly or indirectly will compete against Jio Fin 
Now there is no data out there 
But, as investors, we sometime go by our hunch as well 

My assessment is: Reliance's eventual goal is to become a bank. This as per current norms is not possible. But, rules are formed by rich guys. 

So for every 1Rs I am going to invest in above 5-6 businesses, I will invest 50 paise on Jio (more) 
Valuation wise: Jio doesn't make sense as of now. 

I am simply doing this for hedging perspective.
===========================================================================================
Tech/AI theme, renewae energy, battery pack, healthcare/ pharma but cyclical. Consumer space evergreen
Fin tech, Quick delivery, clean energy etc seem to be a good theme
AMC companies, power sector, ac companies, luxury good company which 
target to specific mass only, like we can see the result of rare rabbit..

Here is some interesting data: 

Last 3 years: 

- Bajaj Finance profit growth has been close to= 50% CAGR (not overall, this is CAGR!) 
- But stock price growth = 0% 

The stock has fallen from a 100+ PE to 25 PE now. 

Point is: 

- When people stop betting on certain themes, the stock price suffers despite great performance

Why am I telling you this? 

Hint: DMART ,TRENT 

Even I am refining my investment thesis with such facts: it is not just about picking good firms, it is also about themes which are likely to move. 

[1] Bad price + bad theme= negative returns 
[2] Good price + bad theme= okay returns or Bad price + good theme = okay returns 
[3] Good price + good theme= exceptional returns 

Which stocks right now you will put in category 3? 

I will also share a list soon.

============================================================================================
[1] So Auto stocks are going through a correction 
[2] Reason is two fold: first, lower consumption happening right now 
[3] Second: these stocks have grown quite a bit. And, are now consolidating 
[4] So if you are looking to build new positions: you have to go slow -- put your investments in 4 equal buckets 
[5] Right now you could consider investing 1 bucket 
[6] I will personally pick Hero Motor right now 
[7] Both are traditional leading players in 2W (EV) 
[8] The demand suppression will come back up 
[9] I am not too bullish on Ola Electric and the likes right now (there is too much risk) in terms of channel management 
[10] The idea is that if you are a new investor on this theme: you could start a bit -- and see how it goes. But, keep in mind that we are just starting 
[11] We might end up picking 4-5 stocks on this theme. And, it will take maybe 1-2 years for us to build our entire positions. 
[12] I will also add:  TVS, Bajaj Auto in this bucket subsequently. Right now, their valuation seems a bit rich. So will wait. 

If you are patient on this theme, you will make money. 
You just have to buy very sensibly. And, slowly.
======================================================================================
Noob investors right now: would be panicking trying to figure out answers like: why did the market fall 1.5% today? 

Well, the answer was always there: technicals. 

I have said it quite explicitly that the technicals tell us that markets are very very likely to fall at support. We are almost there. 

So comes the next points: 

[1] What to do at support? I will personally bulk buy (N50): put 25-30% of the cash bucket I have been savings
[2] Can it fall more? Yes, it can. This is called as channel breakdown 
[3] What to do during channel breakdowns? depends on how much invested you are? But, if you buy an asset like N50 at channel breakdowns (you will make really good money) 
[4] So let's wait and watch to see if channel breakdown will happen 
[5] Else, we simply trade this existing channel and make good money :)

=========================================================================================
1.Jyoti resins (consolidation and volume buying)

- Numbers are good (all time high profits, revenues
- The stock is in a consolidation 
- The PE is not high 

And, honestly the stock hasn't fallen in this market fall. It is just simply consolidating 

- I believe once the consumer demand picks up (might have happened already this festive season); data we will get to know soon 
- The firm might post record numbers
- Expected growth: 30% 

2. Delta Corp 

- Record numbers have been posted in 2023, 2024 
- The stock used to trade around 350, now it is around 115 
- The issue was GST; and a lot of news is being played around this 
- You and i won't get clarity, unless this is finally resolved by authorities 
- Business wise: no problem 
- Upside is 200% at least; not much downside left 
- It is in a downtrend, so technically weak -- but if you are willing to hold for sometime, this can give good returns
- This is a high risk, high reward

3. Armaan Financials 

- Very good results 
- Nothing wrong with the stock 
- Financial stocks (are being beaten down) for pointless reason right now 
- Hence good time to accumulate, hold it and wait 

These businesses on a 3-5 year basis might do well.
But, again play the angle: that Jio Fin can come and take away market share from any of such firms any day 

Also another important point: while NIFTY has corrected close to 10%, Smallcap has corrected almost equally. 
This means: that either NIFTY is going to rise or Smallcap is going to fall more 

And, if Smallcap index corrects, then by default, some good stocks like above can correct further. 
This is a time to make long-term bets, not short-term.
================================================================================

Looks like Donald Trump's victory is good for the market. 

[1] One key economic policy that DT followed was: expansionary debt oriented policy. 

[2] In his personal/professional life, he is a REAL ESTATE guy. He thrives on leverage. He simply kept following this in the first term. 

[3] In his last term: he had taken crazy debt for the nation and undertook extensive public spending. 

[4] This is unlikely to change. 
Add to this: corporate tax cuts. 

[5] All these moves are: (a) inflationary (b) good for stock markets 

[6] Next 5 years are going to be horrid for inflation 

[7] I think staying 50-60% risk, 40% fixed supply assets is going to be the key. 

I have not purchased gold much up until now. Will add that too. 
I have already added a lot of real estate and BTC. All these assets

Along, with high risk stocks (eg. finance) are likely to do well under Donald J Trump
==================================================================================

If you are a conservative investor: Aavas > Asian Paints > Aptus
=================================================================================
gold futures from MCX and keep revolving before the expiry
30% in FDs and debt, 30% in nifty 50, 20% in midcap and smallcap, 10% in btc
Likely correction in gold because of rising interest rates in us. ch k the 10 year yield, its going up. There might be corrections in gold.
